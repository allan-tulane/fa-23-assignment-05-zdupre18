- **1a.**
- . log d (n*(d-1) +1) -1 because its determined by the number of nodes at each level of thr tree. shows the height based on the number of nodes(n) and d .




- **1b.**
- . delete-min = O(log d n) . insert = O(log d n) .



- **1c.**
- . delete-min = O(log d |V|) (V once for each vertex) intsert = O(logd |v|)

bound = O(|V| * log d |V| + |E| * log d|V|) .

- **1d.**
- . the value od d that uses the running time of O(|E|) is log d|V| .



- **2a.**


- **2b.**
- . (i,j,0) represents the shortest paths using only 0 verecices (i,j,1) represents the shorts path using 0 and 1 vertices (i,j,2) represents shortest path for 0,1,2 veticices .



- **2c.**
- . shortest path is using vettices 0 through k-1 or from i to k the shortest path would be from k to j using 0 and k vetices .


- **2d.**
- . since this is using toop down memeorization and the verti .



- **2e.**
- . with top down memorization, there are n^3 subproblems with each subproblem computed only once the total work complexity is O(n^3) .





- **3a.**
- . using the kruskals alogorthm. since it will check at each step adding the current edges. if no tree exists after considering all edges it will conclude no next best tree. .
. time complexity would be O(M * n) thm?
